Constrained BarthDtw stride segmentation
========================================

This example illustrates how subsequent DTW with local warping constrains can be more effective than simple DTW for
stride segmentation in a continuous DTW signal.

In a traditional dtw approach (as used by [1]_ and implemented by :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw`) it
is possible to match extremely short or extremely long signals by stretching the data or the template, respectively.
These matches are usually False-positives.
In :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw` we can use postproccessing steps to remove these matches.
However, because this selection occurs after the actual DTW, it is not possible to recover matches that were
prevented by the existence of such false matches in the first place.

A very typical error that occurs (see below) is that the warping path only covers the second part of a stride (from
IC to TC).
In these cases a small number of samples of the signal are matched to the entire first half of the template.
This results in a vertical step in the warping path.

In normal (aka not subsequence) DTW such "short-cuts" can be prevented by adding a mask to the distance matrix,
that constrains the possible regions the warping path can go through.
However, this is only possible, if the start and the endpoint of the path is known beforehand.
Therefore, these "global" constrains can not be used in subsequence-DTW.
But, it is possible to use local constrains, that prohibit that a single sample of the template is mapped to >N
samples of the signal or that a single sample of the signal is mapped to >M samples of the template.

These constrains are used by :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.ConstrainedBarthDtw` via the parameters
`max_template_stretch_ms` and `max_signal_stretch_ms`.
Note that these parameters can also be used in :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw`, but the
:class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.ConstrainedBarthDtw` has already sensible defaults set.

# Constrained DTW
# ---------------
# As it can be seen above, we have a lot of IC-TC mismatches.
# They result in a steep vertical part in the first region of the warping path.
# We can mitigate that behaviour by restricting the number of template samples that can be warped to the same signal
# sample.
#
# This can be controlled by the `max_template_stretch_ms` parameter.
# It expects a value in "ms" to be independent of the sampling rate.
# This means if we only want to allow 10 matches (but not 11 or more) with the same signal sample, we need to set the
# constrain to 11 / `sampling_rate_hz` / 1000, which means approx 110 ms at a sampling rate of 102.4 Hz.
