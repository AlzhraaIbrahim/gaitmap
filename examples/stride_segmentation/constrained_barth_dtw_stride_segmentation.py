Constrained BarthDtw stride segmentation
========================================

This example illustrates how subsequent DTW with local warping constraints can be more effective than simple DTW for
stride segmentation in a continuous DTW signal.

In a traditional dtw approach (as used by [1]_ and implemented by :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw`) it
is possible to match extremely short or extremely long signals by stretching the data or the template, respectively.
These matches are usually False-positives.
In :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw` we can use postproccessing steps to remove these matches.
However, because this selection occurs after the actual DTW, it is not possible to recover matches that were
prevented by the existence of such false matches in the first place.

A very typical error that occurs (see below) is that the warping path only covers part of the stride.
This is typically either the part from the TC to IC (the start is correct, end not) or from IC to TC (the end is
correct, start not).
In both cases, basically half of the template is warped onto a very small number of actual signal samples.
This is often caused by slight abnormalities in either the first or the second half of the stride, which makes it
unfeasible to include them in the stride.

In normal (aka not subsequence) DTW such "short-cuts" can be prevented by adding a mask to the distance matrix,
that constrains the possible regions the warping path can go through.
However, this is only possible, if the start and the endpoint of the path is known beforehand.
Therefore, these "global" constrains can not be used in subsequence-DTW.
But, it is possible to use local constraints, that prohibit that a single sample of the template is mapped to >N
samples of the signal or that a single sample of the signal is mapped to >M samples of the template.

These constraints are used by :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.ConstrainedBarthDtw` via the parameters
`max_template_stretch_ms` and `max_signal_stretch_ms`.
Note that these parameters can also be used in :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw`, but the
:class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.ConstrainedBarthDtw` has already sensible defaults set.

# Getting some example data
# -------------------------

# While it is hard to pinpoint, why exactly this is the case, it appears to be due to the deep dip of the `gyr_ml`
# signal around the IC.

# Establish a baseline
# --------------------
# Before testing the local constraints, we use the simple `BarthDtw` to visualise the issue.
# We will remove the `min_match_length_s` post-processing step, so that we can see the warping-paths of the mismatches.
# Note, that we only use the "gyr_ml" and "gyr_si" axis for matching.
# In this (and many other cases), this can help recognise more strides correctly, with the risk of segmenting
# "non-strides" as well.

# %%
# Constrained DTW
# ---------------
# As it can be seen above, we have a lot of TC-IC mismatches.
# They result in a steep vertical part of the warping path.
# We can mitigate that behaviour by restricting the number of template samples that can be warped to the same signal
# sample.
#
# This can be controlled by the `max_template_stretch_ms` parameter.
# It expects a value in "ms" to be independent of the sampling rate.
# This means if we only want to allow 10 matches (but not 11 or more) with the same signal sample, we need to set the
# constrain to 11 / `sampling_rate_hz` / 1000, which means approx 110 ms at a sampling rate of 102.4 Hz.
#
# As seen below, this fixes a couple of the mismatches.
# We can see the effect very clearly in the cost function, too.
# Before there were two minima per stride, indicating that the TC-IC match had a very similar cost to the full match.
# Now only the actual end of the stride has a feasible cost.
# However, in the strides that are still not detected, the optimal warping path ends at the correct position,
# by starts in the middle of the stride at the IC (i.e. a IC-TC mismatch).
