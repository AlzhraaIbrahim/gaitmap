def sliding_window_view(arr: np.ndarray, window_length: int, overlap: int, nan_padding: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:
    """Create a sliding window view of an input array with given window length and overlap.

    Warnings
    ----------
    This function will return by default a view onto your input array, modifying values in your result will directly
    affect your input data which might lead to unexpected behaviour! If padding is disabled (default) last window
    fraction of input may not be returned! However, if nan_padding is enabled, this will always return a copy instead
    of a view of your input data, independent if padding was actually performed or not!

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array with shape (n,) or (n, m)
        array on which sliding window action should be performed. Windowing
        will always be performed along axis 0.

    window_length : int
        length of desired window (must be smaller than array length n)

    overlap : int
        length of desired overlap (must be smaller than window_length)

    nan_padding: bool
        select if last window should be nan-padded or discarded if it not fits with input array length. If nan-padding
        is enabled the return array will always be a copy of the input array independent if padding was actually
        performed or not!

    Returns
    -------
    windowed view (or copy for nan_padding) of input array as specified, last window might be nan padded if necessary to
    match window size

    Examples
    --------
    >>> data = np.arange(0,10)
    >>> windowed_view = sliding_window_view(arr = data, window_length = 5, overlap = 3, nan_padding = True)
    >>> windowed_view
