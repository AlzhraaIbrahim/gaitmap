class GyroIntegration(BaseOrientationEstimation):
    """Estimate orientation based on a given initial orientation.

    Subsequent orientations are estimated by integrating gyroscope data with respect to time. Calculations are performed
    by Sabatini et al. [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_orientation
        Specifies what the initial orientation of the sensor is. Subsequent rotations will be estimated using this
        rotation is initial state.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimated_orientations_
        Contains rotations based on initial rotation and trapezoidal gyroscope integration. The first value of this
        array is the initial rotation, passed to the __init__.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    sensor_data
        contains gyroscope and acceleration data
    sampling_rate_hz : float
        sampling rate of gyroscope data in Hz

        Currently the Rampp approach for Gyroscope Integration is hard coded. In future this might be adapted to be
